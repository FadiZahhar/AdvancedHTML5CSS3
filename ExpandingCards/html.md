This HTML code appears to be for a web page featuring "Expanding Cards". 

Let's break it down:

1. **Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`):**
   - This declaration defines the document to be HTML5, which is the latest standard. It helps the web browser to display the page correctly.

2. **`<html>` Element (with `lang="en"`):**
   - This is the root element of an HTML page.
   - `lang="en"` specifies that the primary language of the document is English. It's important for accessibility and search engines.

3. **`<head>` Section:**
   - Contains meta-information about the document.
   - `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which includes most characters from all known languages.
   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`: Ensures the page is responsive and looks good on all devices. It sets the width of the viewport to the device's width and the initial zoom level to 1.
   - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`: Links a CSS stylesheet (`style.css`) to define the styling of the page.
   - `<title>Expanding Cards</title>`: Sets the title of the web page.

4. **`<body>` Section:**
   - Contains the content of the HTML document.
   - Within the body, there's a `<div>` element with a class `container`. This acts as a container for the expanding cards.
   - Inside the container, there are multiple `<div>` elements with class `panel`. Each `panel` represents an individual card.
   - Each `panel` has an inline style for `background-image`, which sets a unique background image for each card (sourced from Unsplash).
   - Within each `panel`, there's an `<h3>` element with a title or caption for the card (e.g., "Explore The World", "Wild Forest", etc.).

5. **External JavaScript File (at the end of `<body>`):**
   - `<script src="script.js"></script>`: Links to an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) which likely contains the functionality for the expanding cards (e.g., how they expand/collapse, animations, event handling, etc.).

Overall, this HTML structure is for a web page that displays a series of cards (with background images and titles), which presumably can expand when clicked on. The actual expanding behavior would be controlled by the JavaScript in `script.js`, and the styling (like card dimensions, fonts, etc.) would be defined in `style.css`.
