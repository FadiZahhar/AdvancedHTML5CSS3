This JavaScript code is designed to work with the HTML and CSS you've shown earlier, particularly for a webpage featuring expandable panels. 

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. **Selecting Elements:**
   - `const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel')`: This line selects all elements with the class name 'panel' from the document (presumably the different panels in your HTML) and stores them in the `panels` constant. `document.querySelectorAll` returns a NodeList (a collection of nodes).

2. **Adding Event Listeners to Each Panel:**
   - `panels.forEach(panel => { ... })`: This line iterates over each panel in the NodeList. For each `panel`, it performs the function defined in the curly braces `{ ... }`.
   - Inside the function, an event listener is added to the current `panel`: `panel.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`. This sets up a function to be called whenever the panel is clicked.
   - When a panel is clicked, two things happen:
     1. `removeActiveClasses()`: This function is called to remove the 'active' class from all panels.
     2. `panel.classList.add('active')`: The 'active' class is added to the clicked panel.

3. **Defining the `removeActiveClasses` Function:**
   - This function is defined to remove the 'active' class from all panels.
   - `panels.forEach(panel => { panel.classList.remove('active') })`: It iterates over all the panels again and removes the 'active' class from each one.
   - This ensures that at any time, at most one panel can have the 'active' class.

In the context of your webpage, here's what happens:

- Initially, all panels are likely to be in a collapsed state.
- When a user clicks on one of the panels, the `removeActiveClasses` function first ensures that any currently expanded panel is collapsed (by removing the 'active' class).
- Then, the clicked panel is expanded (by adding the 'active' class to it).
- This interaction allows only one panel to be expanded at a time, providing a clean and intuitive user experience.

The 'active' class presumably controls the expansion and styling of the panels, as defined in your CSS. When a panel has the 'active' class, it expands (becomes larger), and other styles like visibility of text might change as well.
