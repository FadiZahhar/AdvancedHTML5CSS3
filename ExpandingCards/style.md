This is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code snippet, which is used for styling HTML documents. 


Let's break it down:

1. **Importing Google Font**
   - `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Muli&display=swap');`: This line imports the "Muli" font from Google Fonts, making it available for use in the HTML document.

2. **Universal Selector (*):**
   - `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`: This applies the `box-sizing` property with the value `border-box` to every element in the document. It alters the default CSS box model; the width and height of elements will include padding and borders.

3. **Body Styling:**
   - Sets the font to 'Muli', sans-serif.
   - Uses Flexbox (display: flex) to center its contents.
   - `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center` center the children of `body` both vertically and horizontally.
   - `height: 100vh` sets the height to 100% of the viewport height.
   - `overflow: hidden` hides any overflow content.
   - `margin: 0` removes the default margin from the body.

4. **Container Styling:**
   - Also uses Flexbox to display its children (panels) in a row.
   - `width: 90vw` sets the width to 90% of the viewport width.

5. **Panel Styling:**
   - Each panel has a background set with `background-size: cover`, `background-position: center`, and `background-repeat: no-repeat`, making the background image cover the entire panel, centered, and without repeating.
   - The height is set to `80vh` (80% of the viewport height), and corners are rounded (`border-radius: 50px`).
   - Panels are styled to change their size (`flex: 0.5`) and transition smoothly when their state changes (`-webkit-transition: all 700ms ease-in`).

6. **Panel Heading (`<h3>`) Styling:**
   - Positioned absolutely at the bottom-left of the panel.
   - Initially hidden (`opacity: 0`).

7. **Active Panel Styling:**
   - When a panel has the class `active`, it grows in size (`flex: 5`) and makes its heading visible (`opacity: 1` with a smooth transition).

8. **Media Query for Mobile Devices:**
   - Adjusts styles for screens narrower than 480 pixels:
   - The container takes the full viewport width (`100vw`).
   - Hides the 4th and 5th panels, likely for better display on smaller screens.

In summary, this CSS is likely for a responsive web page featuring expanding panels. When a panel is clicked, it expands in size, and its heading becomes visible. This is achieved through a combination of Flexbox, CSS transitions, and media queries for responsiveness.
